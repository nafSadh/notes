Interview Prep Materials
========================
**WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Study Plan
- **[Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)** -- this became a wildly popular 
compendium of resource for self-paced software engineering training. John Washam wanted to gear up himself as a software 
engineer and embarked on a [8 month long journey
](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-i-studied-full-time-for-8-months-for-a-google-interview-cc662ce9bb13) 
towards being an skilled software engineer. This study plan is overly comprehensive and as John mentioned few times you do not need
to go through everything he went through. My personal recommendation is to go through some of the articles and pick up at least one 
algorithm book (more in it later) and one coding prep book/website (more on it later as well). This linkfarm lists a lot of good 
reading material on specific topic collected from various sources; don't be voracious, eat healthy and read as needed. 
 
> There are few other study plan/ interview prep guide, I'd list them as well. 


## Articles
> Here are some highly cited articles. All of them are personal take on interview process and/or how to ace them. 

- [ABC](https://medium.com/always-be-coding/abc-always-be-coding-d5f8051afce2): "thereâ€™s no silver bullet
to getting hired. But, as an engineer, the best thing you can do is to **ABC: Always Be Coding**" -- this is a nice 
in a nutshell guide for every one. 

## On Books
> There are some books I read and I liked, there are some I haven't but would like to read. Before presenting my personal list 
of books, let me jolt down some good reviews, recommendations and book lists from various sources.

- [Shawn Bullock's Quora answer on best algorithms and data structures books
](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-books-on-algorithms-and-data-structures/answer/Shawn-Bullock-7) -- this 
answer is probably one of the most comprehensive overview of good algorithm books. My mostly agree with him, except, I 
have much more reverence for CLRS than he has. I'm glad that he likes Sedgewick too. 

- [Programming Algorithms & Data Structures](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/126971.Programming_Algorithms_Data_Structures) -- 
a goodreads listof well recognized and revered books on programming algorithms, data structures, problem solving 
and programming challenges.

## Books I like 
> This is a list of books I read and books I'd like to read.

### Algorithms and data structures
- [ ]  **Sedgewick** -- I read his [*Algorithms in C++*](http://a.co/d/9cUnqJI) during my freshman and sophomore years and I loved how 
he handled some very intricate topics. Later on I also looked at the more updated *[Algorithms 4e](http://a.co/d/0LDYqsh)* in 
conjunction with his coursera courses [1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1), 
[2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2). 
- [ ]  **CLRS** -- [Introduction to Algorithms (3e)](http://a.co/d/aVnF8Eu) by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest & Stein -- this is 
undoubtedly the most cited algorithm text book. However this is by no means an intro book. A lot of the materials covered here
are intended for formal undergrad and grad level algorithm courses. If you can, this is one of the best book to read. I specially 
liked graph related topics here during my sophomore/junior year algorithm class. However, I think this is less accessible for many
readers, and many readers won't admit it. 

### Algo Refreshers
- [ ] **Algorithms Unlocked** [AU](http://a.co/d/egtBmR0) by Cormen (C or CLRS) is a nice refresher. This is much thinner than CLRS 
and is written more as a [tradebook
](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-difference-between-algorithm-books-CLRS-and-the-Algorithms-Unlocked/answers/7930807) 
than a text reference.
