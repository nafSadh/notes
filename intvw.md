Interview Prep Resources
========================
**WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Study Plan
- **[Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)** -- this became a wildly 
popular compendium of resource for self-paced software engineering training. John Washam wanted to gear up himself 
as a software engineer and embarked on an [8 month long journey
](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-i-studied-full-time-for-8-months-for-a-google-interview-cc662ce9bb13) 
towards being an skilled software engineer. This study plan is overly comprehensive and as John mentioned few times 
you do not need to go through everything he went through. My personal recommendation is to go through some of the 
articles and pick up at least one algorithm book (more on it later) and one coding prep book/website (more on it later 
as well). This directory lists a lot of good reading material on specific topic collected from various sources; don't be 
voracious, eat healthy and read as needed.

## Articles
> Here are some highly cited articles. All of them are personal take on interview process and/or how to ace them. 

- [ABC](https://medium.com/always-be-coding/abc-always-be-coding-d5f8051afce2): "thereâ€™s no silver bullet to getting 
hired. But, as an engineer, the best thing you can do is to **ABC: Always Be Coding**" -- this is a nice in a nutshell 
guide for every one. 

- [Get that job at Google](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html) -- by ex-Googler, 
blogger [**Steve_Yegge**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Yegge). This is a bit dated, but is still relevant.

- [**Get that job at Facebook**
](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/get-that-job-at-facebook/10150964382448920) -- a former Facebook
engineer describes how Facebook hiring works and how to prepare for it. 



## On Books
> There are a lot of books on algorithms, problem solving, software engineering and computer science in general. There 
are also, as many book-lists. One thing, I'd like to mention is that, picking up a good book is very important. In many
cases people are in a time crunch. So, you want to study a book which you can cover within a limited time; similarly,
you would want to learn enough material and understand them correctly. There are people who have studied and compared 
a good number of books. What they have to say about these books can give you sufficient insight in picking up the right
book. 

- [Shawn Bullock's Quora answer on best algorithms and data structures books
](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-books-on-algorithms-and-data-structures/answer/Shawn-Bullock-7) -- this 
answer is probably one of the most comprehensive overview of good algorithm books. My mostly agree with him, except, I 
have much more reverence for CLRS than he has. I'm glad that he likes Sedgewick too. 

- [Programming Algorithms & Data Structures](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/126971.Programming_Algorithms_Data_Structures) -- 
a Goodreads listof well recognized and revered books on programming algorithms, data structures, problem solving 
and programming challenges.

- [A comparison of four algorithms textbooks
](https://porgionesanke.wordpress.com/2016/07/11/a-comparison-of-four-algorithms-textbooks/): DPV, CLRS, Knuth, Skiena.

### `book list`
> This is a list of books I read and books I'd like to read.

#### Algorithms and data structures
- **Sedgewick** -- I read his [*Algorithms in C++*](http://a.co/d/9cUnqJI) during my freshman and sophomore years and I loved how 
he handled some very intricate topics. Later on I also looked at the more updated *[Algorithms 4e](http://a.co/d/0LDYqsh)* in 
conjunction with his coursera courses [1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1), 
[2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2). 
- **CLRS** -- [Introduction to Algorithms (3e)](http://a.co/d/aVnF8Eu) by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest & Stein -- this is 
undoubtedly the most cited algorithm text book. However this is by no means an intro book. A lot of the materials covered here
are intended for formal undergrad and grad level algorithm courses. If you can, this is one of the best book to read. I specially 
liked graph related topics here during my sophomore/junior year algorithm class. However, I think this is less accessible for many
readers, and many readers won't admit it. 

#### Algorithm Refreshers
- **Algorithms Unlocked**/[AU](http://a.co/d/egtBmR0) by Cormen (the C in CLRS) is a nice refresher. This is much thinner than CLRS 
and is written more as a [tradebook
](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-difference-between-algorithm-books-CLRS-and-the-Algorithms-Unlocked/answers/7930807) 
than a text reference.
