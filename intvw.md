Interview Prep Resources
========================
**WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Study Plan
- **[Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)** -- this became a wildly 
popular compendium of resource for self-paced software engineering training. John Washam wanted to gear up himself 
as a software engineer and embarked on an [8 month long journey
](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-i-studied-full-time-for-8-months-for-a-google-interview-cc662ce9bb13) 
towards being an skilled software engineer. This study plan is overly comprehensive and as John mentioned few times 
you do not need to go through everything he went through. My personal recommendation is to go through some of the 
articles and pick up at least one algorithm book (more on it later) and one coding prep book/website (more on it later 
as well). This directory lists a lot of good reading material on specific topic collected from various sources; don't be 
voracious, eat healthy and read as needed. 

- [**Ace the coding interview, every time**
](https://medium.com/@nickciubotariu/ace-the-coding-interview-every-time-d169ce1fd3fc): An Amazon engineer's take on
how not to fail a technical interview. 

- Andyy Hope on [**software-engineering-interviews**
](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/software-engineering-interviews-744380f4f2af): A recent article outlining how he 
prepared for and got hired at Facebook.

## Articles
> Here are some highly cited articles. All of them are personal take on interview process and/or how to ace them. 

- [**ABC: Always Be Coding**](https://medium.com/always-be-coding/abc-always-be-coding-d5f8051afce2): "there’s no silver bullet to getting 
hired. But, as an engineer, the best thing you can do is to ABC: Always Be Coding" -- this is a nice in a nutshell 
guide for every one. 

- ex-Googler, blogger **Steve_Yegge**[⭷](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Yegge) wrote his famous note on how to 
[Get that job at Google](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html). This is a bit dated, 
but still remains relevant.

- [**Get that job at Facebook**
](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/get-that-job-at-facebook/10150964382448920) -- a former Facebook
engineer describes how Facebook hiring works and how to prepare for it. 



## On Books
> There are a lot of books on algorithms, problem solving, software engineering and computer science in general. There 
are also, as many book-lists. One thing, I'd like to mention is that, picking up a good book is very important. In many
cases people are in a time crunch. So, you want to study a book which you can cover within a limited time; similarly,
you would want to learn enough material and understand them correctly. There are people who have studied and compared 
a good number of books. What they have to say about these books can give you sufficient insight in picking up the right
book. 

- [Shawn Bullock's Quora answer on best algorithms and data structures books
](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-books-on-algorithms-and-data-structures/answer/Shawn-Bullock-7) -- this 
answer is probably one of the most comprehensive overview of good algorithm books. My mostly agree with him, except, I 
have much more reverence for CLRS than he has. I'm glad that he likes Sedgewick too. 

- [Programming Algorithms & Data Structures
](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/126971.Programming_Algorithms_Data_Structures) -- a Goodreads list of well 
recognized and revered books on programming algorithms, data structures, problem solving and programming challenges.

- [A comparison of four algorithms textbooks
](https://porgionesanke.wordpress.com/2016/07/11/a-comparison-of-four-algorithms-textbooks/): DPV, CLRS, Knuth, Skiena.
- An [annotated list of programming books](https://danluu.com/programming-books/) by Dan Luu.

### Book List
> This is a list of books I read and books I'd like to read.

#### Algorithms and data structures
- **Sedgewick** -- I read his [Algorithms in C++](http://a.co/d/9cUnqJI) during my freshman and sophomore years and I 
loved how he handled some very intricate topics. Later on I also looked at the more updated [Algorithms 4e
](http://a.co/d/0LDYqsh) in conjunction with his Coursera courses [1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1), 
[2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2). 

- **CLRS** -- [Introduction to Algorithms (3e)](http://a.co/d/aVnF8Eu) by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest & Stein -- this is 
undoubtedly the most cited algorithm text book. However this is by no means an intro book. A lot of the materials 
covered here are intended for formal undergrad and grad level algorithm courses. If you can, this is one of the best 
book to read. I specially liked graph related topics here during my sophomore/junior year algorithm class. However, I 
think this is less accessible for many readers, and many readers won't admit it. 

#### Algorithm Refreshers
- **Algorithms Unlocked**/[AU](http://a.co/d/egtBmR0) by Cormen (the C in CLRS) is a nice refresher. This is much 
thinner than CLRS and is written more as a [tradebook
](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-difference-between-algorithm-books-CLRS-and-the-Algorithms-Unlocked/answers/7930807) 
than as a text reference. 

#### Interview Prep Books
- Virtually everyone is familiar with [**Cracking the Coding Interview**](http://a.co/d/73OhN0n) by Gayle Laakmann 
McDowell and probably you would be benefited from it too. 



## Video Lectures

> There some really good lectures on fundamentals of compuer science and on some on interview prep

- [**CS50 2017** - Lecture 0 - Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y62zj9ozPOM) -- Harvard's CS50 lectures are 
famous and now most of them are available online. This is a good intro. 

- [**Jackson Gabbard**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcdCkJKXlRoXVD03eo-q8mQ/videos), one of the early Facebook 
engineer made some really great video lectures circa 2016-2017. I really liked them.
