## Study Plan
- **[Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)** -- this became a wildly 
popular compendium of resource for self-paced software engineering training. John Washam wanted to gear up himself 
as a software engineer and embarked on an [8 month long journey
](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-i-studied-full-time-for-8-months-for-a-google-interview-cc662ce9bb13) 
towards being an skilled software engineer. This study plan is overly comprehensive and as John mentioned few times 
you do not need to go through everything he went through. My personal recommendation is to go through some of the 
articles and pick up at least one algorithm book (more on it later) and one coding prep book/website (more on it later 
as well). This directory lists a lot of good reading material on specific topic collected from various sources; don't be 
voracious, eat healthy and read as needed. 

- [**Ace the coding interview, every time**
](https://medium.com/@nickciubotariu/ace-the-coding-interview-every-time-d169ce1fd3fc) -- An Amazon engineer's take on
how not to fail a technical interview. 

- Andyy Hope on [**software engineering interviews**
](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/software-engineering-interviews-744380f4f2af): A recent article outlining how he 
prepared for and got hired at Facebook.

## Articles
> Here are some highly cited articles. All of them are personal take on interview process and/or how to ace them. 

- [**ABC: Always Be Coding**](https://medium.com/always-be-coding/abc-always-be-coding-d5f8051afce2): "there’s no silver bullet to getting 
hired. But, as an engineer, the best thing you can do is to ABC: Always Be Coding" -- this is a nice in a nutshell 
guide for every one. 

- Ex-Googler, blogger **Steve Yegge**[⭷](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Yegge) wrote his famous note on how to 
[Get that job at Google](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html). This is a bit dated, 
but still remains relevant.

- [**Get that job at Facebook**
](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/get-that-job-at-facebook/10150964382448920) -- a former Facebook
engineer describes how Facebook hiring works and how to prepare for it. 



## On Books
> There are a lot of books on algorithms, problem solving, software engineering and computer science in general. There 
are also, as many book-lists. One thing, I'd like to mention is that, picking up a good book is very important. In many
cases people are in a time crunch. So, you want to study a book which you can cover within a limited time; similarly,
you would want to learn enough material and understand them correctly. 
>
> There are people who have studied and compared a good number of books. What they have to say about these books can 
give you sufficient insight for  picking up the right book. 

- [Shawn Bullock's Quora answer on best algorithms and data structures books
](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-books-on-algorithms-and-data-structures/answer/Shawn-Bullock-7) -- this 
answer is probably one of the most comprehensive overview of good algorithm books. My mostly agree with him, except, I 
have much more reverence for CLRS than he has. I'm glad that he likes Sedgewick too. 

- [Programming Algorithms & Data Structures
](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/126971.Programming_Algorithms_Data_Structures) -- a Goodreads list of well 
recognized and revered books on programming algorithms, data structures, problem solving and programming challenges.

- [A comparison of four algorithms textbooks
](https://porgionesanke.wordpress.com/2016/07/11/a-comparison-of-four-algorithms-textbooks/): DPV, CLRS, Knuth, Skiena.
- An [annotated list of programming books](https://danluu.com/programming-books/) by Dan Luu.

### Book List
> Following are some books I studied or vetted and are in my to-read list.

#### Algorithms and data structures

- **Sedgewick** -- I read his [Algorithms in C++](http://a.co/d/9cUnqJI) during my freshman and sophomore years and I 
loved how he handled some very intricate topics. Later on I also looked at the more updated [Algorithms 4e
](http://a.co/d/0LDYqsh) in conjunction with his Coursera courses [1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1), 
[2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2). He authored another book, which focuses on [analysis of algorithms
](http://aofa.cs.princeton.edu/) and thus more mathematical in nature. 

- **CLRS** -- [Introduction to Algorithms (3e)](http://a.co/d/aVnF8Eu) by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest & Stein -- this is 
undoubtedly the most cited algorithm text book. However this is by no means an intro book. A lot of the materials 
covered here are intended for formal undergrad and grad level algorithm courses. If you can, this is one of the best 
book to read. I specially liked graph related topics here during my sophomore/junior year algorithm class. However, I 
think this is less accessible for many readers, and many readers won't admit it. 

- **Skiena** -- Steven S. Skiena is well known in fields of algorithms, programming challenges and data science. His 
[The Algorithm Design Manual](http://www.algorist.com/) 2e balances between practical applications of algorithms and 
academic study of it. This book is organized in two parts: (1) text on algorithms and data structures & (2) catalog of 
algorithms. He resorts to mathematics less often and explains things in detail. This is a nice book to study with and 
keep as reference material. 

- **DPV** -- [Algorithms](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/book/index.html) by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani. 
This book's PDF is officially available for [free
](http://algorithmics.lsi.upc.edu/docs/Dasgupta-Papadimitriou-Vazirani.pdf) online. People have mixed opinion about it. 
IMHO, this is a well balanced and venerable algorithm text. This tends to jump too quickly into mathematics; so if you 
are not match savvy, then this might seem difficult to you. I haven't studied the book in depth yet, but one thing I 
liked about the contents is that, it appears to be industry appropriate. It breaks up algorithms into classes, 
and teaches you how to recognize what kind of algorithm should be used to solve a particular problem.

#### Algorithm Refreshers

- **Algorithms Unlocked**/[AU](http://a.co/d/egtBmR0) by Cormen (the C in CLRS) is a nice refresher. This is much 
thinner than CLRS and is written more as a [tradebook
](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-difference-between-algorithm-books-CLRS-and-the-Algorithms-Unlocked/answers/7930807) 
than as a text reference. 

#### Interview Prep Books

- Virtually everyone is familiar with [**Cracking the Coding Interview**](http://a.co/d/73OhN0n) by Gayle Laakmann 
McDowell and probably you would be benefited from it too. 

- [Programming Interviews Exposed](http://a.co/d/67c44hm) by John Mongan et al. is a very basic book for people who are
totally uninitiated. If *Cracking the Coding Interview* seems difficult for you, you can pick this up to build some 
foundation.



## Video Lectures

> There some really good lectures on fundamentals of compuer science and on some on interview prep

- [**CS50 2017** - Lecture 0 - Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y62zj9ozPOM) -- Harvard's CS50 lectures are 
famous and now most of them are available online. This is a good intro. 

- [**Jackson Gabbard**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcdCkJKXlRoXVD03eo-q8mQ/videos), one of the early Facebook 
engineers, made some really great video lectures circa 2016-2017.



## Coding Practice

> Best way to sharpen your algorithm and problem solving skills is by engaging in [competitive_programming
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming). But if ACM, TopCoder or Codeforces are not your cup of tea,
then you can resort to one of the following:

- [**LeetCode**](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) -- This site originally hosted some two-three hundred programming
interview problem. It was run by Winston Tang, a employee at Google, Amazon and Intel. Recently he started working 
full time on LeetCode and since, the problem archive has grew to about a thousand. It now also organize contests 
regularly, resulting in the surge of problems. First two-three hundred problems cover a wide range of everything; so you
do not have to solve all 900 of them. Also, a good thing about this site is that, if you subscribe to premium, you can 
filter problems by company tags. So, if you are preparing for a particular company, you can review their trend. 
  - My personal suggestion is to, solve a few problems everyday and not to exhaust yourself. They also have a revisit 
  and favorite list. You should definitely utilize these. Also, [session](https://leetcode.com/session/) is a nice 
  feature. 
  
- [**HackerRank**](https://www.hackerrank.com/) evolved from InterviewStreet. It originally provided a tool for 
companies to arrange online coding tests. Later, they started HackerRank for programmers to practice and solve coding
problems. Their problem set ranges nicely from ACM/TopCoder style competitive programming problems to technical 
interview focused problems. 
  - They now have a [Interview Preparation Kit](https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit)
  - I like how they have arranged their problems in different [domains](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/)
  - They also arrange [contests](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests) -- some of them are often sponsored and doing well
  on them may result in direct interview invite. 
  - [ProjectEuler+](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges?) is a nice touch on [Project 
  Euler](https://projecteuler.net). 
  
- [**GeeksforGeeks**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) -- it has a lot of article, some are really good and some are meh.
So use with caution. I have found a lot of their explanations to be spot on and very useful in understanding difficult 
problems.
